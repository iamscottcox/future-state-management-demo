# State

## Next.js

### Pros
* Allows for file based routing
* Adding query params to routes is very simple, and allows us to control a large portion of state via routes

### Cons
* Parameter based routing (e.g [id].js) can be tricky to follow - might just require getting used to.

## React Query

### Pros
* Allows brilliant caching of server requests
* Plays very nicely with Next.js by retrieving search params and adding them to fetch options

### Cons
* Bit of a finicky set up with Typescript (setting QueryKey props for example), but can be circumvented via fetch hooks.

## ReduxJS Toolkit

### Pros
* Far less boilerplate and setup than vanilla Redux
* Allows us to create â€˜slicesâ€™ which return actions and the reducer. These are very simple to set up.
* Bundles commonly used middleware in by default.
* Easy to load into localStorage to persist settings state.

### Cons
* Still requires a fair amount of boilerplate and code setup.
* Doesnâ€™t play nicely with Next.js and localStorage - Requires redux-persist to reliably load props from localStorage.

## React Context

### Pros
* Very little boilerplate, all of it is encapsulated in one file.

### Cons
* A bit finicky to set up with TypeScript. 
  * Requires that you set up functions in `createContext` to return void if they donâ€™t return something later on.

# Components

## Material-UI

### Pros
* Very simple to set up
* Very customizable components
* Allows pass through of classNames or IDs to components
* Nice import syntax
  * Import via deconstruction or default from directory.

### Cons
* Feels 'bloated'...?
  * Tries to do too much?
* Not as visually appealing as other options (and everything is using it these days).

## React Bootstrap
### Pros
* Simple set up.
* Looks really clean!

### Cons
* Doesnâ€™t allow pass through of classNames or IDs to components
* Doesnâ€™t play nicely with Next.js `<Link>` elements
  * React Bootstrap needs `<Nav.Link>` which interferes with Next.js
  * Styling also seems to be an issue - Links show up as navbar background colour instead of white.
  * Can be fixed by adding `passHref` from Next.js `<Link />` component
* Bundles a lot of code into modules. You import `<Form>` for example and receive everything with it.
* Limited scope for theming.
* Classes can â€˜bleedâ€™. Adding .jumbotron as a class to a component makes that component just like any other `<Jumobtron />` component.
* Theming requires .scss files

## Ant Design
### Pros
* Very smooth looking components
* Components do a lot of things and very neatly.
  * Similar scope as Material-UI, but doesn't feel quite so bloated.
### Cons
* Theming via .scss stylesheets
  * No JSON object spreading.
* Janky import syntax. You import a folder and deconstruct into `const`s. Alternatively you can `import` from `antd/dist/*`
* Bad support for TypeScript. Requires an import to an extraneous dependency to access Menu event interfaces.
* Uses Less
  * Not too much of a problem considering that it's more than likely that we'll use styled-components for our own things.
  * If we absolutely MUST use Sass, there's a guide for doing that here: https://gist.github.com/Kruemelkatze/057f01b8e15216ae707dc7e6c9061ef7. It's a bit long-winded though.
  * Requires use of @zeit/next-less which is deprecated and disables Next.js's in-built CSS loaders.
    * Might not be a problem if we're using styled-components?
* Size levels are text based, not numbered.

## Blueprint JS
### Pros
* Written in TypeScript
  * Has its own `*.d.ts` files
* Simple import of CSS (No Less! ðŸ˜€)
* Simple way to add interactivity to `<Card />` components.
* Modules mapped under `@blueprintjs`
  * Shows an understanding of modern library building practices.
### Cons
* Requires the following:
  * Map
  * Set
  * Array.prototype.fill
  * Array.prototype.from
  * String.prototype.startsWith
* Classes prefixed with `bp3`
  * Could be an issue when upgrading to future versions?
* Advocates using `<button>` over `<a>` in `<Navbar />`
* `<Popover />` is deprecated. Use `<Popover2 />` ðŸ¤®
* Passes content as a prop a LOT
  * Bit of an anti-pattern because it prevents flexibility in composability.
* `<Select />` component requires that you specify a new iteration of the component for each type supplied to it.
